# ToyRobot
The Toy Robot is based on a blog post by Jon Eaves. Read it here https://joneaves.wordpress.com/2014/07/21/toy-robot-coding-test/

It's a common test used by a few different Melbourne based companies, and for got reason. It's simple and can be completed in a reasonable time frame, but is also fairly flexible and open ended in the way a developer can approach it. Because of this, you can gain great insight into how the developer thinks about code. Do they consider the problem domain in their code? Do they correctly use design patterns? Are they a functional or object-oriented programmer? Do they over-engineer or practice YAGNI?

The Toy Robot also provides a great starting point for an in-interview pairing exercise. Candidates can work on code they are familiar with, which helps with creating a flowing pairing session in a limited time window.
